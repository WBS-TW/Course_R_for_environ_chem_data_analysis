## Tidy the data files for R

Make sure to clean up and tidy your tables before importing into R.

-   Make sure that the tables have headers in the first row. Keep the variables as columns and samples as rows.

-   Variable names should not start with a number or contain any special characters or space.

-   If a variable contain multiple words, use either the camelCase or snake_case naming conventions:

    -   camelCase: the first word is always in lowercase and every other word starts with a capital letter. The words are also not separated by spaces, dashes, or underscores.

    -   snake_case: each space is replaced with an underscore "\_" character, and words are written in lowercase.

## First glance of the data
