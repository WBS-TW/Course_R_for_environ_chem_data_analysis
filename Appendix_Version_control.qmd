# Version control using Git and Github

### Step-by-step instructions

This guide to install and use Git and Github follows the guide: https://happygitwithr.com

You should consult this website for more detailed instructions.

### 1. [Register a Github account](https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct)

Register a github account: [https://github.com](https://github.com/)

### 2. [Install Git](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git)

**a.** Download git for Windows here: https://gitforwindows.org/

-   NOTE: When asked about "Adjusting your PATH environment", make sure to select "Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software".

-   Note that RStudio for Windows prefers for Git to be installed below C:/Program Files and this appears to be the default. This implies, for example, that the Git executable on my Windows system is found at C:/Program Files/Git/bin/git.exe. Unless you have specific reasons to otherwise, follow this convention.

**b.** Install a Git client, such as GithubDesktop: https://desktop.github.com/

### 3. [Set up keys for SSH](https://happygitwithr.com/ssh-keys#ssh-keys)

**a.** Create an SSH key pair

-   In RStudio, go toÂ *Tools \> Global Options...\> Git/SVN \> Create RSA Key...*.

    -   Passphrase is optional and needed when you want extra security

-   After setting up the SSH key, Go to Tools \> Global Options...\> Git/SVN. click "View public key". Copy the key text to your clipboard (Ctrl+c).

**b.** On Github: - Click on your profile pic in upper right corner - Go to Settings \> SSH and GPG keys. Click "New SSH key". - Paste your public key in the "Key" box. Give it an informative title, presumably repeating the descriptive comment (such as RStudio_LiU) you used above, during key creation. - Click "Add SSH key".

### 4. [Connect your project to GitHub](https://happygitwithr.com/push-pull-github)

It is recommended to first create a new repository in Github and then link it to a new project in Rstudio [GitHub first, then RStudio](https://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first) or link an existing project to the created repository [Existing project, GitHub first](https://happygitwithr.com/existing-github-first)

-   **a. GitHub first, then RStudio**: follow these steps: https://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first#make-a-repo-on-github-2
